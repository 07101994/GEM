###A Fully Open Source Music Player for Android.
GEM is a part of the Substance Open Source suite of apps & promises to be nimble, functional, and customizable.

It is largely inspired by the music player demoed at Google I/O 2014.

####What is Substance?

The brief answer is, an Open Source project for the adoption of Material Design & the betterment of Android ecosystem. We were basically disappointed that all our favorite apps from AOSP didn't get shiny new makeovers. The project started November, 21 2014 with just three people. It quickly jumped to six. We started development on an SMS/MMS client codenamed 'Natter' (now abandoned, Source is [here](https://github.com/Substance-Boneyard) in the Boneyard). Long story short, we joined a larger group (that later collapsed), went into hiatus a few times. But now we are here.

You can learn more about our project [here](http://substanceproject.net/). Feel free to report any issues you may find, or submit patches or features.
####I'm a ROM/Firmware Developer, Can I include Your Apps in my ROM?

Go for it. Our apps are licenced under GPL v3 (Except the ones in the [boneyard](https://github.com/Substance-Boneyard). They are abandoned or depreciated & not bound by a licence, so do what you wish with those.) just like the apps in the Android Open Source Project. So long as you follow that licence, you are good to go.

If you run a serious project, feel free to contact us, we would love to partner with you.
